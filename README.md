## UMI
* [UMI counting issues](https://hemberg-lab.github.io/scRNA.seq.course/construction-of-expression-matrix.html)
![image](img/UMI.issues.png)
* [error correction for cell barcodes and UMIs](https://davetang.org/muse/2018/06/06/10x-single-cell-bam-files/)
* [UMI-tools](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/3/491.full) used a network approach to join UMIs that map to the same location and only differed by 1 bp, which was caused by PCR amplification.

* Read1 (the read containing the cell barcode and UMI) will not have its own line in the bams, the information about read1 is recorded in read2 alignment records

## Introduction to Scanpy
* [Scanpy](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy) use [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/anndata.AnnData.html), which is based on HDF5 to record expression data
* [basic usage of AnnData](http://falexwolf.de/blog/171223_AnnData_indexing_views_HDF5-backing/).


## Dimensionality reductions
*  [PCA plot](https://hemberg-lab.github.io/scRNA.seq.course/cleaning-the-expression-matrix.html#visual-pca)ï¼Œ Convert a set of observations into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components

## experimental issues
*  Appropriate approaches to batch effects in scRNASeq. Red arrows indicate batch effects which are (pale) or are not (vibrant) correctable through batch-correction

## Datasets
*  [Tabula Muris](https://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org/) contains nearly 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues in Mus musculus. [github](https://github.com/czbiohub/tabula-muris).
